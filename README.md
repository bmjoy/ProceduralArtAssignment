# ProceduralArtAssignment
My assignment for Games Engines creating procedural generated art in Unity.

#Infection!

This generation of art is split into 3 parts

1) The Virus
The virus will be partly created in blender and part in Unity depending on what virus I am creating
the virus' so far that i will be generating are:
  
 
  ![E- Coli](/Images/ecoli.jpg)

  
  
  Podovirus

2) The Helpers Cells (Job is to kill the virus)
The "helper" cells job is to find and destoy the virus to stop them from taking over the environment (the body)
the helper cells in this case are:

  White Blood Cells
  
  Antibodies

3) The Environment
The environment in this case will be the body. Different virus' effect diffeent types of the body for example : E-coli will target the intestine where as --------------------------------
For this reason i want to incorperate diffeent parts of the body even though it isnt possible to have the organs shown in such a way in the real vody. I want to display the virus' beauty and have them grouped together.


As you can see in the photos the virus themselves are while terrifying at work beautiful in how they look. In regards to the coding section i will attach a special script to each of these virus' and helper cells that would be their normal behavior if they were to act in the body.

For example in the body ----------- will hide insite of a --------- and get through the ----- undetected. From there it will copy and multiply itself then shoot back out from the ------- and start all over again. In order to combat this if the helper cell that this virus has attatched itself as noticed its presence. It will alert all cells around it to kill it so the virus can be destroyed.
