# ProceduralArtAssignment
My assignment for Games Engines creating procedural generated art in Unity.

**Infection!** </br>
This generation of art is split into 3 parts

**1) The Virus** </br>
The virus' will be partly created in blender and part in Unity depending on what virus I am creating
the virus' so far that i will create will be some or all of the following:
 
  ![E- Coli](/Images/ecoli.jpg)
  ![E- Coli](/Images/virusis.jpg)

**2) The Helpers Cells (Job is to kill the virus)** </br>
The "helper" cells job is to find and destoy the virus to stop them from taking over the environment (the body)
I will create some helper cells as well to hopefully fight the virsus'

**3) The Environment** </br>
The environment in this case will be the body. Even though the virus' that I make are located in different parts of the body for the sake of this I will have them all in the same area.


As you can see in the photos the virus themselves are terrifying but beautiful in how they look. In regards to the coding section i will attach a special script to each of these virus' and helper cells that would be their normal behavior if they were to act in the body.

This video explains how a virus will attempt to sneak into the body which is how i will make them behave in Unity:
